\begin{caseprompt}
What is the brand name of the monitor in the image? What is it's encoding with a Caesar cipher with a left shift of 5. Give your answer as a combined string.
\end{caseprompt}

\begin{casethinking}
Got it, let's break this down. First, find the monitor's brand. \\
\textbf{$\dots$} \\
The logo on the monitor's base is HP. \\
Then, we need to do a Caesar cipher with a left shift of 5. \\
\textbf{$\dots$}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item First, H is the 8th letter (A=1, B=2$\dots$ H=8). Left shift 5: 8-5=3 → C.
    \item Then, P is the 16th letter. 16-5=11 → K.
\end{itemize}
So "HP" shifted left 5 is "CK".

\begin{caseanswer}
HPCK
